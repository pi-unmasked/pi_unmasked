<p> Hello! We are the PI Unmaskers. Our goal is to provide an honest review of various research labs at numerous institutions to bring transparency
to graduate student inequality and turmoils. A rating is assigned to research labs based on various metrics such as estimated graduation rate, publication rate,
student retention, and lab culture (through graduate student and post-doc surveys). Additionally, we believe this website will be useful for graduate students, post-docs, or undergraduates whom are interested
in doing research in labs at certain institutions.</p>
